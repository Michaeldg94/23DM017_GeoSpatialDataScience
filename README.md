# Geospatial Data Science and Economic Models

This repository contains coursework for the **Geospatial Data Science and Economic Models** class. It includes material for our **three assignments** and our **final project**, with code, reports, and supporting references organized by subfolder.

## Repository structure

- `Assignment_1/`  
  Contains the main references/papers used for Assignment 1.  
  We also include the Assignment 1 deliverables (the `.Rmd` source and the compiled `PDF`) in this folder.

- `Assignment_2/`  
  Contains code and deliverables for Assignment 2 (analysis, figures, and final write-up).

- `Assignment_3/`  
  Contains code and deliverables for Assignment 3 (analysis, figures, and final write-up).

- `Final_Project/` (or similarly named folder)  
  Contains the final project work: data processing scripts, analysis notebooks or `.Rmd` files, and the final report.

## Data availability

Some datasets used in this course are **too large to be stored on GitHub**, so the data files are **not included** in this repository.

Where relevant, the code and reports are structured so that we can reproduce results once the data is available locally. When working with this repository, place the required datasets in a local `data/` folder (or any other folder) and update paths if needed.
